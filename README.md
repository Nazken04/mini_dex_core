## Overview

This project is a high-performance, concurrent order matching engineâ€”the core backend service of a financial exchange. Developed entirely in Rust, it provides a robust, low-latency solution for processing limit orders, maintaining an in-memory order book, and persisting executed trades to a PostgreSQL database.

Crucially, this system goes beyond standard exchange logic by implementing a simulation of **Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)**, specifically detecting arbitrage opportunities before they are executed. This demonstrates a deep understanding of the complex and adversarial environments found in Web3 and DeFi protocols.

## Why This Project Makes Me a Strong Candidate

This project was engineered to showcase the specific, high-value skills required for a Rust Backend Engineer role, particularly in the Web3 and FinTech sectors.

### 1. **Goes Beyond Typical CRUD Applications**
Most portfolio projects are simple web apps. This project tackles a far more complex problem: building a stateful, high-throughput, and logically intricate system. It proves I can handle the difficult backend challenges that define high-performance finance and decentralized systems.

### 2. **Demonstrates Deep Rust Proficiency for Performance-Critical Systems**
I chose Rust specifically for its guarantees of memory safety and performance. The implementation showcases:
*   **Asynchronous Programming:** Using `Axum` and the `Tokio` runtime to build a non-blocking API capable of handling a high volume of concurrent order submissions.
*   **Concurrent State Management:** The in-memory order book is managed safely across multiple threads using `Arc<Mutex<T>>`, a fundamental pattern for high-performance stateful services in Rust.
*   **Precision and Safety:** Using the `rust_decimal` crate for all financial calculations to prevent the floating-point errors that are unacceptable in a financial system.

### 3. **Web3 & DeFi Native Thinking (MEV Simulation)**
**This is the key feature.** Simply building an exchange is a backend task. Understanding and simulating MEV is a Web3 engineering skill.
*   **Arbitrage Detection:** The engine actively inspects incoming orders against the current order book to identify and log risk-free arbitrage opportunities.
*   **Proactive Problem Solving:** This demonstrates that I don't just write code; I think about the economic exploits and adversarial conditions inherent in decentralized systems. It shows I can build systems that are not just functional, but also aware of their environment.

### 4. **Professional, Production-Ready Practices**
This project is built and packaged to professional standards:
*   **Containerization:** A multi-stage `Dockerfile` creates a small, optimized, and secure final image. `docker-compose` orchestrates the entire application stack for one-command setup.
*   **Database Integrity:** `sqlx` is used for its compile-time query validation, preventing an entire class of SQL-related bugs from ever reaching production.
*   **Schema Management:** Database schema is managed through `sqlx-cli` migrations, demonstrating a professional workflow for evolving a database over time.

## Architectural Overview

The system follows a clean, logical flow designed for performance and scalability.

## ðŸš€ Live Showcase: Detecting an Arbitrage Opportunity

This tutorial demonstrates the MEV detection feature in action.

### Step 1: Run the Project

(Prerequisites: Rust, Docker, `sqlx-cli` installed)

1.  **Clone & Set Up:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-link>
    cd <your-repo-name>
    # Create the .env file for local use
    echo "DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/mini_dex" > .env
    ```
2.  **Start Database & Run Migrations:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d db
    sqlx migrate run
    ```
3.  **Prepare Offline Data for Docker Build:**
    ```bash
    cargo sqlx prepare
    ```
4.  **Build & Launch the Full Application:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    Wait for the log message `listening on 0.0.0.0:3000`. The system is now live.

### Step 2: The Scenario

We will create a scenario where a bot could perform arbitrage. Keep the Docker logs visible (`Terminal 1`) and open a new terminal (`Terminal 2`) to send requests.

#### Action 1: A Seller Places an Order

A seller places a limit order to sell 5 units at **$45,000**. This becomes the best available price (the "best ask").

*   **Terminal 2 (Client):**
    ```powershell
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://127.0.0.1:3000/order `
      -Method Post `
      -Headers @{ "Content-Type" = "application/json" } `
      -Body '{
        "order_type": "Limit", "side": "Sell", "price": 45000.0, "quantity": 5.0
      }'
    ```

#### Action 2: An Eager Buyer Creates the Opportunity

An eager buyer submits a buy order for 1 unit, but is willing to pay up to **$45,100**. This is a clear arbitrage opportunity: a bot could buy from the seller at $45,000 and instantly sell to this buyer for a $100 profit. Our system will detect this.

*   **Terminal 2 (Client):**
    ```powershell
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://127.0.0.1:3000/order `
      -Method Post `
      -Headers @{ "Content-Type" = "application/json" } `
      -Body '{
        "order_type": "Limit", "side": "Buy", "price": 45100.0, "quantity": 1.0
      }'
    ```

### Step 3: Verification - MEV Detected!

Instantly, the logs in **Terminal 1** will show the detection alert *before* the trade is processed.

    *(Note: You will need to take a screenshot of your terminal showing this log and upload it to a service like Imgur to embed it here.)*

    **Log Text:**
    ```
    mini_dex_core_app  | New order received: Order { ..., side: Buy, price: Some(45100.0), ...}
    mini_dex_core_app  | --- MEV DETECTED ---
    mini_dex_core_app  | Arbitrage: Incoming BUY order at 45100.0 is higher than best ASK of 45000.0. Opportunity to buy at 45000.0 and sell at 45100.0.
    mini_dex_core_app  | --------------------
    mini_dex_core_app  | Trades executed: [Trade { ..., price: 45000.0, quantity: 1.0, ... }]
    mini_dex_core_app  | Successfully saved trade to DB.
    ```
This showcase proves the system is not only functional as an exchange but also demonstrates the deeper, domain-specific awareness required for building robust Web3 applications.
